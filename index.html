Nature refers to the physical world, its living organisms, and natural phenomena like weather, mountains, and oceans,
 encompassing everything not made by humans, providing life's essentials and beauty, and also describes the inherent character of things or people.
It's the source of air, water, plants, animals, and processes like growth and reproduction, 
often seen as a powerful, life-sustaining force, sometimes called "MOTHER NATURE".
Nature is the vast, beautiful, and complex physical world around us, encompassing everything from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies, and all life within them. 
It provides us with essential resources like air, water, and food, and its delicate balance is maintained through intricate ecosystems where different living and non-living things interact. 
The beauty of nature can be seen in its diverse landscapes like mountains and rivers, and the ever-changing seasons,
 but this balance is threatened by human activities like pollution and deforestation, making conservation crucial for the survival of all species, including our own.

	ANIMALS
<div>
Animals in nature are diverse, multicellular organisms living in natural habitats, from insects to vertebrates, playing crucial roles in ecosystems by maintaining balance (predators/prey), aiding plant life (seed dispersal),
 and forming complex food webs, showcasing incredible adaptations for survival through movement, specialized feeding, and diverse classifications like mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and invertebrates.

	 WEATHER 
<div>
Weather in nature is the short-term state of the Earth's atmosphere in a specific place, defined by elements like temperature, humidity, wind, pressure, and precipitation (rain, snow). 
It's what you experience daily (sunny, windy, rainy) and is always changing, driven by energy and water cycles in the atmosphere, unlike the long-term climate patterns. 
Animals also sense and react to these immediate atmospheric conditions.
